## Styleguide

We use [`remark-lint`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) to validate the style of `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Lint configuration lives in `.remarkrc`.

Refer to the [remark-lint rule docs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#rules) when in doubt.

## Testing

To run tests locally you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then:

```shell
$ npm install
